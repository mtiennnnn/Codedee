      <p>4.1 Editor and Programming Language</p>
                <p>(A) Editors. You may use any editor or development environment, including those made available online, as long as your code is not accessible to others during the Round.</p>
                <p>(B) Programming Language. You may use any programming language(s) available on the Codedee website for each solution you wish to submit. It is your responsibility to check the FAQ for information on the currently available versions and configurations for each language. The set of allowed languages and their versions are subject to change at any time.</p>
                <p>4.2 Submitting Solutions for Kick Start Problems.</p>
                <p>(A) Submission Requirements. For each problem, you must submit the source code for your solution through the Codedee website. You must indicate the programming language by using the provided dropdown menu. Your source code must be a single file that is able to run, as is, on our servers. The size of your source code may not exceed 100KB.</p>
                <p>(B) Time, Memory, and Other Resource Limits. A problem or test set may specify time, memory, or other resource limitations. It is solely your responsibility to note any and all resource limitations specified in the problems or test sets.</p>
                <p>(C) Submission Limits. The system may reject submissions if you make too many within a short window of time. The dashboard will display a warning if you are approaching this limit.</p>
                <p>4.3 Judging and Scoring. The solutions you submit will be judged as follows:</p>
                <p>(A) Visible Verdict Test Sets. All Test Sets in the Codedee are "Visible Verdict Test Sets," which means the outcome of the judging will be reported immediately after your submission during the Round.</p>
                <p>(B) Judgment Of Test Sets. Your submission will be judged against each test set in orderâ€”sample (if applicable), then Test Set 1, Test Set 2, etc. If your submission passes a test set, it will be run on the next test set (if any), and so on; if your submission fails a test set, it will not be run on any subsequent test sets.</p>
                <p>(C) Points on Test Sets. For each problem, all submissions can receive points for the Test Sets solved.</p>
                <p>(D) Rank. If you score at least one (1) point in the Round, you will have a rank for that round, which will be determined by your score and your penalty time. Contestants will be ranked in order of highest score first and lowest score last, breaking ties by lowest penalty time first and highest penalty time last. We reserve the right to break ties when necessary based on finer time precision than is shown on the scoreboard. Contestants who score a total of zero (0) points in a Round are not considered as having a rank.</p>
